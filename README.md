# Small Games

It started with a naval battle game in C I was dared by a college friend
to make in less than 15 minutes, but eventually became a repository of small
games that I've made for fun along the years!

If you're learning one of the used languages, hope the games might help you.
If not, hope you have fun!

Current games list:

**C**
- Naval Battle

**Python**
- Hangman
